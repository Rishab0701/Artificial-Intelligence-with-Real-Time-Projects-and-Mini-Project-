This project is about creating a image recognition system to recognize currencies of different countries using Principle component analysis which is a unsupervised machine leaning algorithm that performs classification.
The dataset I am going to use in this project has around 60 images of currency of three countries which are China , Norway and Indonesia in separate folders where all these images are mosly in .jpg format and are rgb/color images only.
Here I mostly used scikit image library (skimage) to read the images from the directory , display the images , resize images , convert RGB images into grayscale images(so that the array size reduces from 3 to 2).

To make it easier and effective I am going to create class called as ImagepreProcessing which will have functions defined for executing process such as reading the images, converting all these images into gray scale images and finally resize all images into a single size for uniformity.
To extract more features from the image for more accurate image recognition I used histogram of oriented gradients algorithm imported as hog from scimage.feature
Hog is applied through iteration for each and every image in the directory so we can finally convert the all the images into histogram of oriented objects.
Now we have to flatten the obtained two dimensional into a single dimensional vector so using the flatten function from numpy module we are going to flatten and reshape the array.
Final step in image pre-processing is going to be converting array into a dateframe using panda module and create a new row with label as the name of the country whose currency we have processed.
Now Repeating all these steps for other two data sets (currency data) and  finally we get three data frame which are combined using concate function of panda module to create a final data frame.
You sing the shuffle function from SQL and utils we are going to shuffle the data set and we are going assign a dependent independent variable the independent variable is going to be containing the row of the country name and all other rows goes to the dependent variable so using a model selection module of a scalar we are going to report train distance split and we are going to speak the data such a way that is going to be 25% of the total size and the training size will be remaining 75% I have the dividing training and testing set where going to apply support commission algorithm which is a supervis learning machine learning which means we are going to give both the input and output to the computer so that it learns from that training set and we are going to give the test set to the computer to verify how much after fitting the data and using predic function predict the values from the training set and comparing it with the test results be finally performer accuracy score using a matrix module from scalar in my project accuracy came out to be 77.5% to create a confusion matrix to see how much is calculations have been done the given test set so to get high accuracy answers I am going to use principal component analysis to prepare the training centre by reducing it's dimensions it is on supervising learning algorithm which means only give the

training set training set of depend and variable only which means it as to figure out on so for that I want to use module quality composition after applying principal component analysis explain into a new variable call exchange BCA and we are going to give the extreme PCA in the place of X-Ray in support vector machine algorithm and we are going to use the predic function and after that compare with weight test and the curiosis code for that is 0.825 which is 82.5 percentage which has increased a lot of model is finally 82.5 percentage accurate and if I need your confusion battery is also display that see how much calculated
